          <p>Even if your house looks like it came straight out of a 1950’s catalogue and you think you might need extensive work just to get it to a state that you can even call a realtor, you might be wrong!</p>

          <p>Yes, there is no argue that selling an old house is difficult, if you sell it traditionally it can take a few months and lots of $$ to get it to look good enough to be sold, but most likely the reason that you didn’t spend that money back when you were living in that house is the same reason you don’t want to spend it now before selling it.</p>

          <p>Just an example for the costs you might be facing: standard prices for changing a roof could go between 5,000 and 7,000, and that’s just the average it can go up to 30,000 in some case with special materials. Painting the house could go up to $3000 and installing a new floor is between $2500 to $4500.</p>

          <p>Off course not everyone would need to replace everything but in most cases taking an old home and fixing it up to the point its show ready could reach high costs and create lots of stress of dealing with contractors, experts and more.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Some people decide to go on the adventure of trying to fix it up and get it market ready but fail to take into account a few factors:</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Fixing up the kitchen alone could cost a lot more than you might think and it will dramatically impact your asking price</li>
            <li>Deep cleaning of the property might take longer than you think</li>
            <li>Replacing hardwood floors, carpets or tiles will alot cost a of and without it your asking price will drop</li>
            <li>Unfinished construction of some parts like garage or basement could also decrease the value of your home and will cost a fortune to update.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The bottom line is that sometime you might need to spend more time and money fixing up the house just to increase its value by a fraction.</p>
