          <p>Many Memphians fall into arrears on their mortgage. Some mortgage companies work with their customers to
            modify their loans to allow them to rectify the situation. Unfortunately, most lenders will look to
            foreclose and take possession of your property. This will most likely result in your mortgage lender selling
            your property by auction, and using the proceeds will be used to cover the legal costs and repay the
            mortgage balance.</p>

          <p>As devastating as a foreclosure notice is, people need to know that they have options, Most lenders will
            not take action until you are a few months behind on your payments, You have the power until that point. You
            need to consider some of the alternatives to accepting the foreclosure, such as a deed in lieu of
            foreclosure, short sale or loan forbearance, Should these measures fail, bankruptcy is a better option than
            foreclosure for the following reason.</p>

          <p>We are very aware that both Foreclosure and Bankruptcy are words that fill people with dread. What you
            don't know is that for people facing foreclosure, bankruptcy could result in you keeping your house
            altogether. Let me explain how. One of the first things that a court will do when it receives either a
            "Chapter 7" or a "Chapter 13" bankruptcy application is that they will issue an automatic stay to prevent
            your creditors from collecting on your debt. This will usually buy you an extra three or four months.</p>

          <p>The lender has the right to file a motion to have the stay lifted. If this is granted, you will most likely
            not receive that extra time. But bankruptcy will generally result in a delay of two to three months. If the
            Foreclosure Notice has already been approved, there are statutes in most states that require your lender to
            give you a minimum notice period. In Tennessee, they are required to provide 60 days notice.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the
            experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
            valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <h3>What will a successful Chapter 13 filing do for you?</h3>

          <p>A successful Chapter 13 will allow you to repay the debt through a structured plan. You will be required to
            clear the arrears and any other payments that are due. As long as you can prove you can meet the repayments
            and make them, you will be allowed to stay in the house
            If you have a 2nd or 3rd mortgage, under Chapter 13, the courts usually categorize these mortgages as
            unsecured loans because the house is acting as security for the first mortgage. These are given last
            priority status and, in many cases, are never repaid.</p>

          <h3>What will a successful Chapter 7 application do for you?</h3>
          <p>If you are lucky enough to secure a Chapter 7 ruling, all debt attached to your home will be canceled. The
            new legislation also allows for any losses incurred by the owner to be written off against Tax. You do need
            to remain aware of the fact that the possibility of losing your home is still a reality. Your debts will be
            cleared, but your agreement with the lender states that the house is collateral against your mortgage.
            Chapter 7 forgives your debt, but will not fit a lien, and in all probability, you will still lose the home.
            On top of that, the courts have an obligation to your creditors to try and make them whole again; this means
            other assets are at risk. Even wedding rings have been seized as they were above the amount of money granted
            to you during bankruptcy.</p>

          <h3>What will this mean for your credit?</h3>

          <p>Both bankruptcy and foreclosure are going to be detrimental to your credit in short to medium term. But you
            need to consider your future, foreclosures damaged credit for years, and you still need to repay the
            mortgage debt. Bankruptcy offers the chance of a fresh start; you can immediately begin rebuilding your
            credit.</p>

          <p>To learn more about your options, you should talk to a bankruptcy attorney. They will be able to discuss
            the ramifications of a foreclosure vs. Bankruptcy in Tennessee, with you in greater detail. They are experts
